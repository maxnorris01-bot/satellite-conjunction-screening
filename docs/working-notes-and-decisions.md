# Working notes and decisions log - Satellite Conjunction Screening Tool

This is a different kind of record from `docs/sessions/*.md`. Session docs narrate what changed in
one sitting and are written for someone with zero context picking up the diff. This file is the
opposite shape: short, durable entries - a decision plus *why*, or an open item worth remembering -
meant to be skimmed months later when the reasoning behind something has otherwise been forgotten.
Append to it whenever a real decision gets made, not just at the end of a session. If something is
already fully documented elsewhere (a technical fix in a session doc, a known failure in the
README, a design tradeoff in an ADR), point to it here rather than duplicating it.

## Decisions

**2026-09-27 - Risk-table thresholds (ADR 0004's heuristic, first numbers).** Values are in
`config/screening.yaml`; the rules are in `src/app/risk/risk_model.py`'s docstring.
- `high_miss_km: 1.0`. Fresh LEO TLE/SGP4 position error is roughly 1 km and grows with element
  age. A predicted miss under 1 km therefore can't be told apart from a hit using this data, and
  that's where "high" starts.
- `moderate_miss_km_active: 2.5`. That's half the screening threshold. It gives an active payload
  (something with an owner and maybe a thruster) extra margin that a debris-debris pass doesn't
  get.
- `hypervelocity_km_s: 1.0`. Above about 1 km/s any contact is energetic enough to be
  catastrophic. Below it, the encounter looks more like slow proximity drift than a crossing.
  Nearly all real crossings are far above this (median 13 km/s in session 1). The threshold only
  separates the rare slow case.
- A SATCAT-less object counts as possibly active. A screening tool should err toward surfacing a
  pass, not hiding it.
- Treat all of these as defensible starting points, not calibrated values. Nothing to calibrate
  against exists until a later session compares with Space-Track CDMs or SOCRATES.

**2026-09-27 - Between-sample detection and co-located pairs.** A sample-only
`distance < threshold` check at a 60 s step misses almost every real encounter. See
[ADR 0006](adr/adr-0006-between-sample-closest-approach-detection.md) for the padded-radius +
linear-TCA + SGP4-refinement design and the docked-vehicle "co-located" split.

**2026-09-27 - Elements come from CelesTrak's OMM JSON, not TLE lines.** The stations group
already has catalog numbers above 99999 (e.g. 100057 SOYUZ-MS 29). Those don't fit a TLE line
without Alpha-5 encoding. `sgp4.omm.initialize` builds a `Satrec` straight from the JSON fields,
and the mean-element content is identical. `CatalogObject.elements` keeps the raw OMM record rather
than line1/line2 as the spec sketched.

**2026-09-27 - Object type/status from CelesTrak SATCAT, not Space-Track.**
`celestrak.org/satcat/records.php?GROUP=<g>&FORMAT=JSON` gives `OBJECT_TYPE` (PAY/R/B/DEB/UNK) and
`OPS_STATUS_CODE` with no account, which is everything `assess_risk` needs. ADR 0001 planned to get
this from Space-Track. Space-Track is now only needed for a supplemental TLE feed or CDM
cross-validation, so it's off the MVP's critical path. "Active" means `PAY` with status `+`, `P`,
`B`, `S` or `X`.

**2026-09-27 - Drop elements older than 14 days before propagating.** 53 of 1,968 Fengyun-1C
fragments had epochs 15-27 days old. SGP4 error from elements that stale is far larger than a 5 km
threshold, so their "conjunctions" would be noise. They're dropped and listed in the report's
`scope.dropped`, not silently discarded. The value is `max_epoch_age_days` in config.

**2026-09-27 - Code lives under the template's `src/app/` package, not a renamed one.** The spec's
module sketch (`data/`, `propagation/`, `screening/`, `risk/`, `reporting/`) is mirrored as
subpackages of `app`. Renaming the package would touch the template's eval harness, tracing and
config imports for no functional gain in session 1. It's easy to do later if the name matters for
the portfolio.

**2026-09-27 - Screening config is `config/screening.yaml`, not `config/thresholds.yaml`.** The spec
suggested `thresholds.yaml`, but `evals/thresholds.yaml` already means "eval pass/fail gates" in
this template, and two different files with the same name invite confusion.

## Open items / parking lot

- **Session-1 scope has no stations-vs-debris overlap.** The stations fly at 385-426 km and
  Fengyun-1C debris sits around 800 km, so every flagged pair was debris-debris and the "high" rule
  never fired. The stations group contributes only co-located docked vehicles. A supplementary run
  of `iridium-NEXT` + `fengyun-1c-debris` found 50 debris-vs-Iridium passes under 5 km (13 rated
  moderate). That's a better demo scope, pending a decision (see `docs/todo.md`).
- **Cosmos-1408 debris has mostly decayed.** CelesTrak's `cosmos-1408-debris` group returned only
  about 2 objects on 2026-09-27, so it's no longer useful as a debris-cloud demo.
- **Memory, not just time, blocks full-catalog scale.** All-pairs index arrays at 30k objects would
  be about 7 GB. 24 h x 60 s position + velocity arrays would be about 2 GB. ADR 0003's KD-tree
  fixes the first. The second needs time-chunked propagation. Numbers are in the session-1 summary.
- **Co-located detection uses relative speed only.** A slow drift toward collision would be
  classified co-located and never rated. See ADR 0006's consequences.
- **ADR 0001 still says SATCAT metadata comes from Space-Track.** Worth a one-line status note on
  that ADR, since CelesTrak's SATCAT now covers it (see the decision above).
